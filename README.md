### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stories" help with this?
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp;A main facet of agile development is focusing on creating value for the customer. Most of this value is centered around the people who will ultimately be using the software being developed â€” the user. Features bring users to the application and provide value to the user's life in some way. One of the best ways of encapsulating these features at a high level is user stories. They are written from the users' perspective and focus on their experience. Encapsulating features centered around the user is both one of the easiest and most effective ways of creating a blueprint for a software application. These user stories can then be ranked and organized by their importance and size. Large user stories can be broken down into multiple stories as needed. They carry a low cognitive burden, speeding up requirements analysis in the development process. Conclusively, user stories are intuitive, quick, and easy to create, easily organized, and focused on the user experience and value created for the user, making them the most popular way to create requirements in modern software development.
